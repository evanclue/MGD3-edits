hi i'm clue.
this is a WIP edit to [DarkBahamut162's MGD3 theme.](https://github.com/DarkBahamut162/MGD3) with the goal of making textures HD.


## here's how to set up an accurate MGD3 experience in project outfox
* get [project outfox](https://projectoutfox.com)
* download [this theme](https://github.com/evanclue/MGD3-edits/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
* put the theme in the outfox Appearance/Themes folder
* download this pack of [MGD3 RandomMovies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yUtG9TSgezMn0SnFHq9lFReDZzsNLnGO/view?usp=sharing)
* place the RandomMovies folder in the root of your outfox folder, next to Program, Save, etc.
* download this [MGD3 song pack](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y357PG8iWPFJjWljbcZsHbul3PLhCmgG/view?usp=sharing), which preserves the group structure of the original game
* delete everything in your Songs folder, and extract the MGD3 pack in there
* go into your Appearance/Noteskins folder and delete literally everything in there and replace it with [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xkg4uVeCaqBxg081Kn77PaFAoJ5_X7iG/view?usp=sharing) (thanks to DarkBahamut once again for [porting the noteskin](https://github.com/DarkBahamut162/global))
* go into outfox settings, user experience, appearance, and set the theme to MGD3
* also set default noteskin to mgd3

* this edit has more features for playing on an arcade cab, so if you care about that, here's how to do arcade things
* go into settings, input, advanced input
* set navigate menus with menu buttons, option navigation to arcade style, and menu navigation to 3-key for a DDR cab
* also go into arcade options to enable free play which disables all the other shit on the main menu, and if you decide to do that, you gotta go into appearance > UI options, then skip caution
* restart the game

* u should be good 2 go!
